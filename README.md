# Choco Pie OS

> What if π wasn’t just a number, but an entire operating system?

Choco Pie OS is a **browser-based desktop operating system** built using a modular, OS-like architecture. It combines creativity, education, and system design into a single interactive platform inspired by **Mathematical π, Raspberry Pi, and Pie**.

## Architecture Overview

Choco Pie OS is designed like a real operating system:

- **OS Shell** → Desktop, window manager, taskbar, notifications  
- **App System** → All features run as modular applications  
- **App Dispatcher** → Controls app rendering and lifecycle  
- **State Management** → Centralized using Zustand  
- **Core Services** → File system, theme engine, event system  
- **Subsystems** → VS Code Lite, GamePi, Pi Apps
